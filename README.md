Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality sofware systems.
importance: enables creation of software applications and systems that run various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a. mobile apps like whatsapp which has enabled people from different parts of the world to communictae and connect in the shortest time possible.
b. web applications like google has enabled us to access information.
c. development of different operating systems like windows which helps manage and organise the computer resources.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. project planing- determing the project purpose and the desired outcome.
b. requirements - analyzing the the project and choosing on your go
d. design- checking if the design is suitable ffor the client.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall has afixed timeline
agile they are more flexible 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- uses programing knowledge to create software that can be used and meets the need of users.
project manager- is to plan, organise and direct the progress of different tasks.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs helps develop code efficiently
VSC is the best practice for high performing software.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. INcreased number of customer- Creat projects to reach the demand for diffrent customers and there problems.
b. time- the project might be time consuming maybe extend deadline dates for 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a. Unit testing is is a process of testing specific units and components and it helps to validate that each unit performs.
b. intergration- is when different software components and modules are combined and tested as a group it helps to expose potentional defects between the various modules.
c. system- checks for system compliance in accordance with the given requirements.
d. acceptance- is done by the user. helps to validate.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
promp engineering is the process of guiding AI i.e chatgpt to generate desired solutions for my problem.
importance
it makes work easier since th solutions are automatically generated. lets say i want to revamp my cv using chatgpt ill just sent the file and tell it to add the things i wanted to add without necessarily doing it myself.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
define agriculture and biotechnology,
prompt  "Define agriculture and biotechnology, and explain how they are interrelated. Discuss the significance of biotechnology in modern agriculture and the potential benefits and challenges it presents." This prompt encourages a detailed exploration of both fields and their connection, highlighting their importance in contemporary society.
